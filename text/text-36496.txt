Exo Drones is a rapidly growing drone company that aims to fill the gap in the market between cheap drones and DJI's collection. The company was established around the same time DJI was added to the US Entity List due to concerns about data privacy. Exo Drones prides itself on not selling customer data and focuses on providing affordable, high-quality drones.

The CEO of Exo Drones, Charlie Canon, started the company after experiencing frustration with expensive DJI drones that had connectivity issues and lacked customer support. The mission of Exo Drones is to offer great customer service and bridge the gap in the drone market.

Exo Drones partnered with Hubsan, a drone manufacturer known for its quality hardware but lacking in software and customer support. This partnership allows Exo Drones to provide Hubsan with US backing and improve their software and customer support in the American market.

In August 2022, Exo Drones was acquired by OpenStore, further strengthening their position in the market. One of Exo Drones' popular models is the Exo Mini Pro, which is comparable to DJI's Mini 3 Pro. The Exo Mini Pro offers an adjustable aperture, a feature usually found in professional photography drones. It also connects via USB, which makes it quicker to set up compared to DJI drones that connect via Wi-Fi. The Exo Mini Pro has obstacle avoidance at the front and back, a 1/1.26" sensor, and is priced between the Mini 2 and Mini 3 Pro.

The Exo X7 Ranger Plus is another popular model from Exo Drones. It is comparable to drones like the HS720E, Ruko F11 Pro, and DJI Mini SE. The standout feature of the Exo X7 Ranger Plus is its 3 axial gimbal, which provides excellent image stability. The Blackhawk 2 is another model from Exo Drones that offers features like an 8km range, 4k video, and 35 minutes of flight time per battery. However, some users have reported issues with the gimbal and GPS system.

Comparing the Blackhawk 2 to the DJI Mavic Air and Hubsan Zino 2, the Blackhawk 2 offers more intelligent flight modes but has a lower image quality compared to the Zino 2. The DJI Mavic Air has a larger sensor and can take 48MP photos, but the Blackhawk 2 Pro from Exo Drones has a 48MP camera as well.

Overall, Exo Drones is an exciting competitor in the drone market, offering affordable options with high-quality features. While DJI remains a dominant player, Exo Drones provides an alternative for those looking for a cheaper option. The company continues to improve and release new models, and it will be interesting to see what they have in store for the future.
